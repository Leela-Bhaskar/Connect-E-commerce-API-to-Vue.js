🚀 Getting Started
Since this is a single-file application that relies on CDNs, there's no complex build setup required.

Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Installation & Launch
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo-name

Open the file:
Simply open the index.html file directly in your web browser.

That's it! The application will be up and running locally.

💡 How to Use
Browse Products: Scroll through the product grid to see all available items.

Filter by Category: Use the dropdown menu at the top to select a category and view specific collections.

Add to Cart: Click the "Add" button on any product card to add it to your shopping cart. The button will provide visual feedback.

Manage Cart: View your selected items in the cart sidebar on the right. You can remove items by clicking the trash icon.

View Total: The total price of your cart is calculated and displayed in real-time.

🔗 Connecting to a Backend API
Currently, the product data is mocked directly within the Vue app's data() object. To connect this frontend to your own e-commerce API, you would modify the script section:

Add a mounted() lifecycle hook to your Vue app.

Use fetch or axios inside mounted() to make a GET request to your API endpoint that returns a list of products.

Update the this.products array with the data received from your API.

Example:

// Inside the createApp({...}) object

mounted() {
    // Fetch products from your API
    fetch('https://your-api-endpoint.com/products')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            // Add the addedToCart property to each product
            this.products = data.map(product => ({ ...product, addedToCart: false }));
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching products:', error));
},

// ... rest of your data, computed, methods

🔮 Future Improvements
Product Detail Page: Implement routing to show more details for a single product.

State Management: Integrate a state management library like Pinia for more complex cart logic (e.g., quantity).

Checkout Process: Build out a multi-step checkout form and integrate with a payment gateway.

User Authentication: Add user login and registration to save cart contents and order history.
